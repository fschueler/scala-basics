#### Tips for learning

- Don't try to learn every funky feature at once.  Focus on the core, and the strange stuff will come in time.
- In situations where you have a choice of tools/frameworks (Maven vs. SBT for build tools, IntelliJ vs. Eclipse for IDEs, etc.), choose one to learn now instead of trying to master both.
- Make friends who can help you out of ruts, but don't bother them too much.
- It's okay if you don't fully understand something the first time you see it.  Read a lot of resources, one of them will click.
- Seriously, make friends.  Go to a meetup.  Get a twitter handle.
